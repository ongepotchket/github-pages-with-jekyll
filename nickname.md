This is a page I'm writing mostly as an experiment in what *content* might look like if I decided to be a *content-producing influencer* of innumerable follows.

## What should we call me?

My "government name" is **Richard**. It's a nice enough name, but I don't get called Richard very often. Recently, I've been called Richard far more often than ever before. I think it's because 1) it is the name string in my professional email address, and 2) it is how I usually address the court on the record.

Plenty of nicknames for Richard. I grew up as **Ricky**, which is all anyone called me for a long time. But in college, I decided I ought to honor my namesake, Dick. **Dick** was my grandfather. He died when I was in the wombâ€”in fact, I gave my first kick about 45 minutes afterward. Failing to see any downsides, I introduced myself in a few classes as Dick. It was a lark. 

I returned to exclusively introducing myself as "Ricky" in New Orleans, although some dear friends called me **Rack** or **Zachy**. When I showed up at law school, I thought seriously about taking up "Dick" full-time. I figured I had only two real junctures at which to announce myself anew: At the start of law school and at the start of my first lawyer job. This was relatively good thinking, and I ignored it. Instead, halfway through my final year, I learned that I could easily change my email name string. I was "Dick" electronically and in a few classes, for 4 months.

Nobody knows what to do with a name change these days, because nobody wants to inadvertently undermine someone's very serious change of identity. But what about when a change of identity *isn't* serious?

I don't know, and nobody does, and it doesn't matter much anyway. You can call me whatever you like, just don't call me late for dinner.

## Epilogue

Almost immediately after I began seeing my partner, I started calling her by a nickname that 
1) didn't sound like her name, 
2) isn't a normal nickname, and 
3) was the result of an in-joke with her but without her consent. 

If you think this makes me a bad dude, I think maybe you're jumping to conclusions, but I hear you. Anyway, she named her cat after an internet start-up, so nobody is exactly innocent here.
