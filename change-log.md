## Unofficial changelog

This is sketchy but pretty close to true events.

* 2000-ish: Developed first personal website. 
  * Copied bits of javascript I'd found to make a page that offered different ways of crashing your computer. For instance, one was a button that would minimize the window. The page would automatically maximize whenever minimized, and minimize whenever maximized. This was sufficient, in 1999 if I am right about the date, to simply crash the computer.
* 2010-ish: Rejecting the cool kids on Twitter and other social media, I made a Sina Weibo account while procrastinating. The platform was not available in English and the automatic Google Translations were terrible, so I did a very poor job establishing myself there. 
  * I think I had no followers (hard to tell), and I was unable to figure out how to follow anyone else. Influencer status not yet achieved.
  * Charitably, perhaps I was shadow-banned for mentioning a certain massacre in several posts.
* 2020: My brother already has a fun site in Jekyll. It is a long quarantine weekend and I need a break from sort of exhausting professional/paraprofessional work. I am also envious of my cool friends' cool productivity.
