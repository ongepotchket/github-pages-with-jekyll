I'm a public defender and other things. I live in Philly, which is nice but also weird. I miss New Orleans and Chicago and Pittsburgh and Romeâ€”descending. I don't miss suburban New Jersey too much, except that I miss Tabatchnick's and that's where I buried my childhood dog.

I don't know what to do with a website, but it feels like once I've put one together, I might have better ideas. I'm worried that it will be less substance and more procedure, another way to merely collect and re-present[^1] information in an accessible or pretty[^2] way.

## Unofficial changelog
* 1999: Developed first free online website. After a few months, copied bits of javascript I'd found to make a page that offered different ways of crashing your computer. For instance, one was a button that would minimize the window. The page would automatically maximize whenever minimized, and minimize whenever maximized. This was sufficient, in 1999 if I am right about the date, to simply crash the computer.
* 2010: Rejecting the cool kids on Twitter and other social media, I made a Sina Weibo while procrastinating. The site was not available in English and the automatic Google Translations were terrible, so I did a very poor job establishing myself. I think I had no followers and was unable to figure out how to follow anyone else. Charitably[^2], I may have been shadow-banned for mentioning a certain massacre in some posts.
* 2020: My brother has a fun site in Jekyll. It is Memorial Day weekend and I need a break from sort of exhausting professional/paraprofessional work.
