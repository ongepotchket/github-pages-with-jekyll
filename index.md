I'm a public defender and other things. I live in Philly, which is nice but also weird. I miss New Orleans and Chicago and Pittsburgh and Romeâ€”descending. I don't miss suburban New Jersey too much, except that I miss Tabatchnick's and that's where I buried my childhood dog.

I don't know what to do with a website, but it feels like once I've put one together, I might have better ideas. I'm worried that it will be less substance and more procedure, another way to merely collect and re-present[^1] information in an accessible or pretty way.

[^1]: Unhyphenated representing is my day job.
